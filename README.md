# Student-Is-Future_Kaggle

* In this kernel we had tried to find out the performance of the student based on the factors like math score,writing score, reading score, father's occupation.
* Through this we are able to find how the family situations could help the student in it's performance in the long run.
* The plot(Countplot) was basically done  mostly in this kernel to find the situations of the family in the environmet.
* The kernel is really helpful when you will be going to start the practice
